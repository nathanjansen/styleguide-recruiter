# API Documentation

Use the Protocol API to access contacts, conversations, group messages, and more and seamlessly integrate your product into the workflows of dozens of devoted Protocol users. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="/colors" arrow="right" children="Colors" />
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="outline" children="Explore SDKs" />
</div>

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sdks"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Get your API key"
  />
</div>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>


    ```bash {{ title: 'Vue' }}

    # cURL is most likely already installed on your machine

    curl --version

    ```



    ```bash {{ language: 'php' }}

    # Install the Protocol PHP SDK

    composer require protocol/sdk

    ```


</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
    <Button
        href="/sdks"
        variant="text"
        arrow="right"
        children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
    />
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

    ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
    curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
    -d limit=10
    ```

    ```js
    import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

    const client = new ApiClient(token)

    await client.conversations.list()
    ```

    ```python
    from protocol_api import ApiClient

    client = ApiClient(token)

    client.conversations.list()
    ```

    ```php
    $client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

    $client->conversations->list();
    ```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
    <Button
        href="/conversations"
        variant="text"
        arrow="right"
        children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
    />
</div>
